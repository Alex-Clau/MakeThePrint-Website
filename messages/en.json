    "storyP2": "Right now, we've got a collection we're genuinely proud of. These are designs we've chosen because we think they look incredible when printed. But here's the thing—if you've got something specific in mind, just reach out. We love a challenge, and we'll do our best to make it happen.",
    "storyP3": "The plan? We want to keep growing. More printers, more products, a real online store. Every single person who orders from us is helping us get there. We're not some faceless company—it's literally my dad and me packing these boxes, making sure everything's perfect. When you support us, you're supporting two people who actually care about what they're doing.",
